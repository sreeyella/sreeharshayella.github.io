        <h2> Brief summary of some html tags</h2>
	<p>All html doucments start with a statement &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt which specifies the browser to interpret the text below as HTML and display it accordingly. </ br>
	    HTML uses different tags to present the content in an effective way. Most html tags contain a opening and a closing. Together with the content inbetween the opening and closing tags, the whole thing is called an html element. Below is a gist of some basic html tags.</p>
        <ul>
	  <li> &lthtml&gt, &lt/html&gt: This is the main tag in an html document. Everything else resides in between these tags. </li>
	  <li> &lthead&gt, &lt/head&gt: This tag contains the meta information about the html page such as title and style information. </li>
	  <li> &lttitle&gt, &lt/title&gt: This tag contains the title of the current html page. It is not displayed on the content of the page but on the banner of the browser (or tab).
	  <li> &ltbody&gt, &lt/body&gt: This tag contains the body of a html document which is displayed to the user. </li>
        </ul>
