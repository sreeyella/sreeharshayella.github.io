          <h2> Brief summary of some html tags</h2>
            <p>All html doucments start with a statement &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt which specifies the browser to interpret the text below as HTML and display it accordingly. </ br>
            HTML uses different tags to present the content in an effective way. Most html tags contain a opening and a closing along with some attributes. </ br>
	    Together with the content inbetween the opening and closing tags, the whole thing is called an html element. Below is a gist of some basic html tags.</p>
            <ul>
	      <li> &lthtml&gt, &lt/html&gt: This is the main tag in an html document. Everything else resides in between these tags. </li>
	      <li> &lthead&gt, &lt/head&gt: This tag contains the meta information about the html page such as title and style information. </li>
	      <li> &lttitle&gt, &lt/title&gt: This tag contains the title of the current html page. It is not displayed on the content of the page but on the banner of the browser (or tab).</li>
	      <li> &ltnav&gt, &lt/nav&gt: This tag specifies the links to the navigate to major links within the page and outside the page.</li>
	      <li> &ltbody&gt, &lt/body&gt: This tag contains the body of a html document which is displayed to the user. </li>
	      <li> &lth1&gt, &lt/h1&gt: This tag is used to display the headings of sections inside a html page. The tags go from &lth1&gt, &lth2&gt, ..., &lth6&gt which specify the importance of the heading which is reflected in the size of the headings in the decreasing order. </li>
	      <li> &ltp&gt, &lt/p&gt: This tag is used to display paragraphs in a html page. </li>
	      <li> &lt/ br&gt: This tag is used to specify the line breaks in the html text. This tag comes alone without a closing tag and the forward slash inside the tag is optional but recommended to facilitate better parsing of the html pages.</li>
	      <li>&lta&gt, &lt/a&gt: This tag specifies links to the other urls. The urls are presented using the attribute href.</li>
	      <li>&ltimg&gt: This tag is used to display images. The link to the image is given using the attribute src and the image can be size can be specified using the attributes width  and height. The attribute alt can be used to describe the image which would be displayed if the link to the image is broken or will be used to describe the image for visually challenged users.</li>
	      <li>&ltvideo&gt, &lt/video&gt: This tag is used to display the videos. Unlike the images the videos have to be present in the local filesystem and cannot be displayed using urls to the external websites.</li>
